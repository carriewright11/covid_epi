## {.disclaimer_block}

**Disclaimer**: The purpose of the [Johns Hopkins IDD COVIDScenarioPipeline](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVID19_Minimal){target="_blank"} project is **to provide tools for analysis of COVID-19 related data**. These materials do not cover all aspects of the research process. We highly suggest that you seek external consultation from scientific experts regarding your data and the interpreation of your data. 


This tutorial assumes that users have knowlege of R programming and limited command line experience. It does not require previous knowlege of GitHub.

## **GitHub**

If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step and move onto the [**Getting Started with the Pipeline**] section.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a site that allows users to **host** and **manage** code and data files. Thus, you can **store** your code on the web so that you and others can easily access it (and so that is safe if something happens to your computer!).

It is especailly useful for what is called [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control){target="_blank"} which allows you to **track changes** to documents overtime. 

So although it is intended for version control of code, you can actually use GitHub for version control of many types of documents.

### Why do I need an account?

By signing up for an account you can easily access up-to-date files and code for the **COVIDScenarioPipeline** to allow you to easily run the pipeline on your data.

Better yet, if you learn more about GitHub, you can also use your account to save the files and code for your analysis and track changes over time. You can share your analysis privately with just your team or you can even make it public for others to use.

To learn more about GitHub see [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/){target="_blank"}.


### Create a GitHub Account: 

1) Click this [link](https://github.com/)  

You will see a page that looks something like this:  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","GitHub.png"))
```

2) Fill out a username, email, and password  
3) Click the green "sign up for GitHub" button

## **Getting Started with the Pipeline**

### Making a pipeline repository

First navigate to the Johns Hopkins IDD **COVIDScenarioPipeline** github repository: by clicking [here. ](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVID19_Minimal){target="_blank"}

You will see a page that looks like this:
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","UseThisTemplate.png"))
```


Click on the green button that says "Use this template" as shown in the above image.

  
***   

This will take you to a new page that looks like this:
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","GenerateRepo.png"))
```



Here you will:  

1) Provide the name for your repository that you are about to create - "COVID_Pipeline" would work 
2) Decide if you want your repository to be Public or Private   
3) Press the green "Create repository from template" button  

Great! Now you have a repository on GitHub which contains all the current [**COVIDScenarioPipeline**] ](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVID19_Minimal){target="_blank"} files and code.

***

### Get the pipeline files onto your computer

1) Open a new project in Rstudio  (if this is new for you see [New to Rstudio])

2) Select the Terminal tab





*** 


We will begin by loading the packages that we will need:

```{r}
library(here)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```


 Package   | Use                                                                         
---------- |-------------
[here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here){target="_blank"}       | to easily load and save data
[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}      | to import the CSV file data




## **What are the data?**
*** 

If you want to make a table about variable info:

Variable   | Details                                                                        
---------- |-------------
**variable1**  | Variable info  <br> -- more details <br> -- more detials <br>  **Example**: Content content  
**variable2**  | Variable info  <br> -- more details <br> -- more detials <br>  **Example**: Content content

## **Data Import**
*** 

Put files in docs directory and use `here` package.

```{r}
pm <-readr::read_csv(here("docs", "pm25_data.csv"))
```

## **Data Exploration and Wrangling**
*** 

We will also use the `%>%` pipe which can be used to define the input for later sequential steps. This will make more sense when we have multiple sequential steps using the same data object. To use the pipe notation we need to install and load dplyr as well.

Scrollable content:

#### {.scrollable }
```{r}
# Scroll through the output!
pm %>% 
  distinct(state) %>%
  print(n = 1e3)
```
####


## **New to RStudio**
*** 

If you are new to RStudio, dont worry!

First download RStudio from [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

You will also need to have R installed.
